Code from ACL 2023 paper: Membership Inference Attacks against Language Models via Neighbourhood Comparison. See their [Repo](https://github.com/justusmattern27/neighbour-mia/tree/main)__

The environment used: Google Colab

This repository only contains the results from the experiments.__

The experiments were conducted using Google Colab. Please note that this repository only contains the experiment results. Unfortunately, I could not include files for the OpenLLaMa experimentation due to GPU memory issues. However, I have a picture that shows the AUC results for the model, which I have attached as a cell output. I struggled to keep the loaded models and other files due to their large size and cached nature. I lost files whenever I had to restart the runtime due to storage issues, and they were too big for my drive.
