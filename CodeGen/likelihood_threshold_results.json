Stewards have not confirmed the penalty but Hamilton's Mercedes team have accepted it is inevitable. It is a blow to Hamilton's attempts to close the championship deficit to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. On Friday, Hamilton was fastest in the second practice session, ahead of title rival Vettel. Hamilton was 0.147 seconds quicker than Vettel at the Red Bull Ring, with the second Mercedes of Finland's Valtteri Bottas 0.216secs off the pace. Hamilton is 14 points behind the German heading into Sunday's race at the Red Bull Ring, having dropped two further points at the last race in Baku when he finished fifth, a place behind Vettel. Hamilton was leading that race and was on course for victory but had to pit to have a loose head restraint fitted. That was a significant blow because Vettel had been given a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for dangerous driving after deliberately hitting Hamilton's car. Hamilton's problem meant he returned to the track behind Vettel and was unable to pass. Mercedes said the problem had not been caused by the incident with Vettel in Baku. Hamilton, 32, said it was \"important\" to make up ground on Vettel in Austria and the British Grand Prix a week later. \"I've lost points in the last race and I need to reverse that,\" he said.

In 2006, Mr Bainimarama ousted the elected government of Laisenia Qarase, accusing it of corruption and bias towards indigenous Fijians. Since then, Fiji has been under military rule. Mr Bainimarama said he wanted to end the instability and in these elections discarded the race-based voting system.

Voters with poor vision can adjust the font size and screen colours, or have the candidate names read off.

The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is launching a recruitment film to trigger a change. The Welsh government says an extra \u00a310m is being spent on primary care. RCGP Wales spokeswoman Dr Payne, who teaches medical students at Cardiff University and works as a GP for an out of hours service in north Wales, said it is hard to know exactly how many more GPs are needed in Wales. \"Patients are telling us they are struggling to get appointments and we are working harder and harder,\" she said. The Welsh government said, overall, GP numbers in Wales have increased by 11% between 2003 and 2013. But the RCGP reckons more GPs will be needed across the UK as the aging population continues to grow. Its film aims to \"tackle media stereotypes of general practice as less stimulating and exciting than other medical careers\". Meanwhile, Health Minister Mark Drakeford has announced that an extra \u00a36m will be spent over the next year to help healthcare professionals and free up GP time look after people with more complex needs. Another \u00a34m will be spent on improving access to community care. In all, 64 primary care \"clusters\" have been set up across Wales of GP practices working with pharmacists, dentists, optometrists, therapists, nurses and healthcare workers.

Currently the fee is chargeable on any estate worth more than \u00a35,000. This threshold will rise to \u00a350,000, meaning that 57% of estates will pay nothing.

In April 2015 - just as schools re-opened after the Ebola crisis - the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology issued a statement banning pregnant girls from mainstream education and from sitting exams. The ban was enforced through invasive physical examinations of the girls. Just under two years on, and the ban is still in place. Learning centres typically specialising in skills such as catering, tailoring, and hairdressing act as alternatives to school and are open to pregnant girls. Olivia Acland photographed these girls, collecting their stories, and discovering that girls very rarely return to mainstream education after being pushed out of it. Twenty-year-old Emma said: \"I moved to this learning centre when I got pregnant and am studying catering. At my old school I had to tell my teacher I was pregnant because she caught me sleeping at the desk. After that I was pulled into the principal's office and told not to come back.\" Isatu is 18 and wants to be a hairdresser, she said: \"I am learning the skills in a learning centre near to where I live.

The signatories now have two years to report back with an action plan. Experts say treatment-resistant infections pose one of the biggest known threats to humanity today. Without urgent action, it is conceivable that simple infections could soon become entirely untreatable with existing drugs. The problem has been caused by over-use of antimicrobial medicines for humans, animals and agriculture. Repeated exposure allows bacteria and other infections, including HIV and malaria, to learn how to dodge these treatments by mutating and evolving.
